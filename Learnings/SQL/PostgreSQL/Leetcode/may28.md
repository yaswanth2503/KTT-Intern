Source: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/database/

1. 3374.First Letter Capitalization II
* creation of usercontent table
```sql
create table usercontent(content_id int, content_text varchar);
```
* Insertion of data into usercontent table
```sql
insert into usercontent (content_id, content_text) values (1, 'hello world of sql'), (2, 'the quick-brown fox'), (3, 'modern-day data science'), (4, 'web-based front-end development');
```
* Write a solution to transform the text in the content_text column by applying the following rules:

    Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase
    Special handling for words containing special characters:
    For words connected with a hyphen -, both parts should be capitalized (e.g., top-rated â†’ Top-Rated)
    All other formatting and spacing should remain unchanged
    ```sql
    select content_id,content_text as original_text, initcap(content_text) as converted_text from usercontent;
    ```

2. 608.Tree Node
* creation of tree table

```
* Insertion of data into tree table
```sql
insert into tree (id, p_id) values (1, null), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2);
```

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write a solution to report the type of each node in the tree.
```sql
    select id,
    case when p_id is null then 'Root'
