1. Main Points & Uses of ORM:
    ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) lets you interact with the database using objects instead of SQL.

    It maps database tables to JavaScript classes and rows to objects.

    Makes database operations (CRUD) simpler and cleaner in code.

    Helps avoid manual SQL queries and reduces repetitive code.

    Ensures database-agnostic code – switch databases with minimal changes.

    Automatically handles relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many).

    Popular in frameworks like Sequelize (Node.js), Hibernate (Java), Django ORM (Python).

    Boosts productivity, readability, and maintainability of code.

    Good for rapid development and cleaner architecture.

    Ideal for developers who want to work more with code than raw SQL.

    Mapping: ORM systems map classes in code to tables in the database, 
    object attributes to table columns, and object instances to rows in those tables


2.Sequelize 

    Sequelize is a popular ORM for Node.js used with SQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

    It allows you to define tables as models using JavaScript or TypeScript.

    You can perform CRUD operations using methods like .findAll(), .create(), .update(), .destroy() etc.

    Helps avoid writing raw SQL queries — makes code cleaner and more maintainable.

    Supports data validation, associations (relationships), and migrations easily.

    Works well in Express.js-based full-stack applications for backend DB management.

    Makes it faster and easier to build database-driven apps with less boilerplate code.

    You can still use raw queries if needed for full flexibility.


3.Here are the top Node.js ORM alternatives to Sequelize:

        1. TypeORM

        2. Prisma
        ✅ Modern, type-safe ORM
        ✅ Auto-generated queries
        ✅ Built-in migrations

        3. MikroORM
        ✅ TypeScript-first
        ✅ Supports SQL + NoSQL
        ✅ Data Mapper pattern

        4. Objection.js
        ✅ Lightweight ORM (built on Knex)
        ✅ Easy relations (like Sequelize)
        ✅ Supports raw SQL when needed

        5. Drizzle ORM
        ✅ Ultra-lightweight
        ✅ Type-safe SQL queries
        ✅ No runtime overhead

        6. Bookshelf.js
